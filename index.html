				<h2>(ME) ? "Who Am I" : "Where I came from"
					<br />

				</h2>
			</header>
			<p>My full name is Fungai Marshall Mangondoza, born and raised in Zimbabwe, a country in Southern Africa. This is where
				I spent most of my junior studies. In 2009 I was enrolled at
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ciu.edu.tr/">Cyprus International University</a> in Cyprus, as the name implies. In my second year I transferred to
				<a target="_blank"
				 href="https://ww1.emu.edu.tr/en/">Eastern Mediterranean University</a> also in Cyprus. On the 17th of February 2015, I managed to graduate with a Bsc in
				Management Information Systems, having a CGPA of 2.9/4.
			</p>
			<p>
				During my studies, I was introduced to web development at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.innoviadigital.com/">Innovia Digital</a> as an intern.
				My primary role was assist with code snippets in between projects and handle customers who has small requests. This gave me an opportunity to review senior dev code while I was at university.
				This made a difference in my career goals and what I wanted to achieve
			</p>
			<p>My official professional path started immediately graduation after getting an opening as a full time web developer at a Digital Agency called
				<a target="_blank" href="http://atabilisim.pro">Ata Bilisim</a>. The company gave the developer full control over a project from design to deployment, and for 3 years,
				my experience and skills as a professional web developer increased. At first made code directly into themes for clients but dug deeper into custom wordpress plugins as client needs grew. </p>
			<p>After 4 years, at my previous job. I moved to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nethouse.net/">Nethouse Networks</a>. The biggest internet service provider in North Cyprus. The journey has been exciting. I managed to create 3 online dashboards, 3 mobile apps both for ios and android and contribute to the team effort.</p>

				<h2>What I believe? | Principle
					<br />
				</h2>
			</header>
			<p>It can be summed up in two: provision and growth.
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Provision | </strong>A man is measured by how many people he provides for, a man who provides for himself is less than
						he that provides for his family, in turn he that provides for his family is less than he that provides for his society...</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Value Of Learning | </strong> I strongly believe in continuous learning as the only way to life. Learn new cultures,
						new people, new ways to achieve and new skills. In terms of my job, it makes you able to offer quality by default to
						clients, which is a satifying feeling to know that you are able.</li>

			<h2>How I spend my free time.</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<p>The heading is misleading rigtfully so. There is no free time when you do the things you love everytime.
					When not at my 9-5 day job, I run an online travel agency promoting african destinations
					<a target="_blank" href="https://skybornetravel.com/">Skyborne Travel Agency</a>  was born out of the combination of my skills as a web dev and the need to showcase where I came from.
					A beautiful place that everyone can enjoy. The website itself is built on laravel and everyday I do more to improve it.
					<br>

				<p>I am also a fan of hanging out with friends, camping, football, yet in the end I see myself as an introvert who enjoys
					life with a small circle of people. My
					<a title="Fungai Marshall Mangondoza Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/mrfmarshall" target="_blank" title="My Facebook">facebook account</a> might tell a different story.</p>
				<p>All the above gives an overview of my time away from work as I chew across the life in search of new skills and experiences.
					I take myself as a very eager person to learn and absorb new skills in terms of programming and general life experiences.
